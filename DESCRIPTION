Description: The package specifies common/unique factor scores in matrix decomposition factor analysis (MDFA). The specification is attained by minimizing MDFA's loss function with L2 penalization. The package provides two types of specification; regression and clustering version. Regression version specifies the score by regressing some external criteria on the scores. Clustering version specifies the score to cluster the observations.
